### while making this app i learned:

- about `requestAnimationFrame()` and `requestIdleCallback()`

- safari, among other modern web browsers, does not currently support the screen orientation api

  - as such, we should strive to make user experiences consistent across all platforms

- waiting to call `alert()` or `prompt()` until after a reflow/repaint is tricky

### and i got more practice with:

- classes in js

- the model-view-controller pattern

### and i took inspiration from:

- https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown

- https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown-client

### there's a lot that could still be done, like:

- [ ] adding new features, such as:

  - [ ] animations

  - [ ] difficulty by:

    - [ ] allowing enemies to attack together

    - [ ] including a boss ship

    - [ ] making enemies stronger after each battle

  - [ ] more sprites

  - [ ] perks, including:

    - [ ] medals

    - [ ] missiles

    - [ ] shields

- [ ] allowing the user to target any enemy

- [ ] initiating the battle with a random number of enemies, as opposed to just 6

- [ ] prompting the user if they'd like to play again
